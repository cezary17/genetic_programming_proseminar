  Genetic Programming is a subdomain of Search-Based
  Software Engineering, primarily inspired by the Darwin's
  Theory of Evolution. A genetic program differs from an
  ordinary, explicit program in that the programmer is not
  trying to directly calculate the solution but instead
  "evolve" an algorithm using a loss function. In this paper
  I will give an overview of the topic, consisting of the
  history of the domain of Genetic Programming and the
  deviances of genetic Programs from standard, explicitly
  written Programs. Further I will showcase some possible
  applications of the genetic approach to building software
  and also go into the limitations of that approach.
